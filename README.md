# MapEventManager

A windows form application that displays a map containing different events to allow people with cognitive brain problems, such as dementia, to see where they have been and what they have been doing. When selected it gives information to that user to help remind them of their activities to help to give extra security and confidence to the user as well as reduce anxiety.

1.	Image events have custom images displaying, with the user able to choose images from file. For example, they can choose a playground image from file and set it to the event to show they were at a park. This can also be done with videos.

2.	Each event can have its information altered (such as its title and/or information) when the app is running. Elements can also be deleted completely from the map. These alterations are then saved to the XML file, meaning changes can be enacted even the user restarts the program.

3.	A calendar that contains all the events. When the user selects a day, it will show all the events that were created on that day. Selected that event will take you to that event on the map, then close the calendar and bring up that events information automatically.

4.	Find an event by name or move by latitude and longitude.


5.	The application can create a line to show a basic route from the userâ€™s current location to an event. Will also determine the distance the current location and the event. 

6.	The application can create a route and link between all the different events depending on when each event was created, showing the general path that the user has taken to allow them to keep track of where they have come from and how. This gives linking to ALL events.

7.	A bus stop finder. Clicking this button will take you to the nearest bus stop and display the name of the bus stop.
